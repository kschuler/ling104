## Getting help

- **Comment on google docs & slides:** Each week you'll be given links to lecture slides, notes, and assignments (see [Schedule](#schedule)). One way to get help from instructors or classmates is to ask questions right on the documents. 

- **Piazza:** The best way to get help anytime is to ask a question on the [Piazza discussion board](https://piazza.com/upenn/fall2020/ling104). Instructors will typically respond to questions within 24 hours.

- **Office Hours:** If you prefer chatting with a person, you can join one of us for video Office Hours on Zoom. If our posted hours don't work, email Katie or Yiran to set up an appointment for another time.


## Overview

### Description
This course offers an introduction to the brain basis of language. Its primary goal is to introduce students to the study of the brain and language by combining basic concepts from linguistics, psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience. We will consider, through lectures and readings, a number of questions: What areas of the brain underlie language processing and acquisition? What are the fundamental functions of these brain areas and how do these functions overlap with other cognitive processes? How is language impacted when one of these areas is damaged? And what are the methods and approaches researchers use to examine these questions? This is an introductory course and no specific background is assumed or required.

### Materials

- **[Course website](index.html)** (you are here) for schedule, policies, and links to all assigned materials and a **[Canvas site](https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1530046)** for announcements and grade related things.
- **[Class blog](https://languageandthebrain.org)** for group projects
- **[Piazza](https://piazza.com/upenn/fall2020/ling104)** for online discussion

### Evaluation
- **Exams (75%)** - There are four take-home exams, but the lowest exam score is dropped.
- **Moonshot group project (25%)** -  You'll work in groups of 3 to find a solution to a big question in language and the brain. Your group will write 6 blog posts on your progress (25 points each) and present a poster (virtually!) on the final day of class (100 points).

### Extra Credit
-  **Community engagement:** For each moonshot assignment, earn 5 points by making kind, constructive comments on other teams' blog posts. 

## Schedule
Schedule is subject to change. All lectures will be recorded and [posted on Panopto](404.html) a few minutes after each class.

## How to do well in LING104
- Keep up with watching the lectures (live or later) and do the assigned readings
- Be a good citizen in your moonshot group.

## Policies
- **Attendance**: There is no formal attendance policy, but participation is highly correlated with class performance.
- **Rescheduling or make-up exams**: Because we drop your lowest exam, we do not offer retakes or make-up exams. But please contact us if something extreme happens - a family or medical emergency, for example - and we can discuss some options provided you have documentation.
- **Late assignments**: Late blog posts will be accepted with a 1  point per day late penalty.
- **Re-grade requests**: If you notice a grading error, we'd be happy to look at your exam again. To request a re-grade, please fill out the re-grade request form via canvas *within one week of receiving your graded exam or assignment*. We want to be fair to everyone, so if you ask about grading in person or via email, you'll be directed to make a formal request via the regrade request form.
- **Accommodations and non-discrimination**: We are happy to provide accommodations to anyone with documentation from Student Disability Services and to make alternate arrangements when class conflicts with a religious holiday. Please notify Yiran as soon as possible to make these arrangements.
- **Academic Integrity**: We will follow the rules of the University and the [Code of Academic Integrity](https://catalog.upenn.edu/pennbook/code-of-academic-integrity/).  It is your responsibility to be familiar with these policies.
- **Support**: Asking for help is a sign of strength! We hope you'll reach out to us if you need help. We also want you to be aware of Penn's [Academic](https://www.college.upenn.edu/index.php/support) & [Wellness Resources](https://www.wellnessatpenn.com/)

## FAQs

**Can I skip the fourth exam if I am happy with my grade on the first three?**
> Yes! You can skip the fourth exam and it will be dropped. Your grade will be based on the first three exams.

**I noticed a mistake in the grading of my exam. How do I get this fixed?**
> We will look at your exam again if you make a formal [re-grade request](https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1489351/modules/items/17298855) via Canvas within one week of getting your exam back.

**I missed or failed an exam. What can I do to make it up?**
> Nothing. We don't allow make-up exams or retakes. However, we drop your lowest exam score, so you can still do well in the class. Just make sure it doesn't happen more than once!

**Can my team turn in our blog post late?**
> Yes, but there is a 1 point per day late penalty.

**I participated in an experiment (or attended a talk). When will I get my bonus points?**
> To receive bonus points, you must (1) make a [bonus points declaration](https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1489351/quizzes/2285014?module_item_id=17260181) on Canvas and (2) write about your research experience in your [language journal](resources/language-journal-assignment). Your bonus points will be awarded as soon as you make your declaration, but we will check your journal (and SONA records, if you participated in an experiment) to confirm these points at the end of the semester.

**What does it mean to be "engaged" on perusall?**
> Read more about how engagement is computed on perusall [here](resources/how-perusall-works.pdf) and see a sample [here](https://perusall.com/downloads/scoring-examples.pdf).

**How do I watch the lecture live?**
> I'll send a link just before our usual class time via Piazza for those who want to watch the lecture live. You'll click the link to watch and can login with your PennKey if you'd like to make live comments to me. I'll pause periodically to answer questions I see.

**I'm in a different time zone, will I miss anything?**
> No, definitely not! The lectures will be recorded so you can watch them any time you like. All discussions will take place on Piazza, so you read through the discussions any time, and also add your own comments and questions whenever you can.
